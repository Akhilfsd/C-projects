This C program is a console-based movie ticket booking system. It allows users to select from three movies and choose their seats in two blocks (Block A and Block B), each with different pricing. The program utilizes file handling to store and retrieve booking information for multiple movies. Users can view seat availability, make seat selections, and receive a total booking amount. The program features a visually appealing color-coded interface and updates seat availability after each booking. It concludes by saving the booking status to a file for future reference.
